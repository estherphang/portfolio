          "why": "<p>I embarked on this project due to a common concern that many individuals, including myself, face: tracking expenses and understanding where our money goes by the end of each month. As I reflected on my financial habits, I realised how difficult it was to recall every expense, making it even harder to comprehend why I couldn't save as much as I desired.</p> <p>Specifically, remembering expenditure details for distinct categories such as transportation, food, and shopping proved to be quite daunting. I needed clarity to manage my finances effectively and plan for the future.</p><p>Recognising the widespread relevance of this issue, my teammate and I decided to tackle it head-on by developing Thrifty and Co, a financial app designed to address these challenges. In addition to tracking expenses and categorising them, we integrated a split bill function into the app. This addition stemmed from our observation that our age group frequently engages in activities like having lunch with colleagues or dining out with friends. We felt that having a feature to split bills effortlessly would significantly enhance the user experience and promote financial transparency among peers. </p><p>Therefore, we started this project to gain better insight into our personal finances and to provide a solution that could benefit others facing similar dilemmas in managing their expenses and social outings.</p>",

This personal touch not only fostered a sense of pride but also facilitated better interactions and networking among the participants.</p><p>One of my key contributions was designing the color theme of our uniform. We chose red to represent Singapore, reflecting the colors of our national flag, and complemented it with blue to symbolize trustworthiness and harmony. Additionally, I designed the logo for the Singapore Contingent. The ship in the logo represented the Nippon Maru, the vessel hosting the program, while the 28 windows symbolized each of the 28 participants. We also incorporated SG50 into the logo to celebrate Singapore’s 50th anniversary, with the sun motif representing a bright future.</p><p>In addition to these visual elements, I coordinated various marketing strategies to ensure our contingent's activities and achievements were effectively communicated. This included managing our social media platforms, creating engaging content, and highlighting key events and milestones throughout the program. Our goal was to not only promote our contingent but also to inspire and connect with a wider audience, sharing the values and experiences that SSEAYP fosters.</p><p>Through these efforts, we were able to create a cohesive and memorable identity for the Singapore Contingent, enhancing our presence within the SSEAYP community and beyond. The experience was incredibly rewarding, as it allowed me to leverage my skills in marketing and design to contribute to a meaningful international initiative.</p>",
