      <p className="mt-4">
        I am a creator at heart, with a diverse background in coding, marketing,
        and design. I have a knack for developing innovative marketing
        strategies and enhancing user experiences through visually stunning

      <h2 className={`${title2}`}>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        In my previous career spanning over a decade, I ventured into the realms
        of marketing, design, and operations. Throughout this journey, I
        immersed myself in the dynamic intersection of creativity and
        problem-solving, exploring diverse avenues to bring innovative ideas to
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        From crafting compelling marketing campaigns to designing captivating
        visuals, and optimizing operational processes, I honed my skills in
        creating impactful solutions across various domains. Yet, amidst these
        endeavors, a new path beckonedâ€”one that promised boundless opportunities
        for creativity and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for crafting solutions
        that push boundaries, I embarked on a new chapter: studying coding. This
        pivot represents a natural evolution of my journey, as I transition from
        creating digital and physical products to exploring the vast realm of
        software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey is anchored in the belief that creativity knows no bounds and
        that every challenge presents an opportunity for innovation. With coding
        as my canvas, I aspire to continue my exploration of the endless
        possibilities of creation, aiming to develop software and applications
        that not only solve problems but also inspire and empower others.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I venture into this exciting new chapter, I remain committed to
        embracing the spirit of creativity, continuously pushing the boundaries
        of what is possible, and creating solutions that make a meaningful
        impact in the world.
